                    <p>Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) is one of the most effective, reality-based fighting systems in the
                        world. Offering healthy exercise and living, BJJ builds and tests your strength, flexibility,
                        and cardio in a way that few other disciplines can. BJJ builds great bodies and rewards it's
                        students with discipline, dedication, focus, patience.

                        Our Jiu Jitsu Class teaches the basic objectives of the main positions in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.
                        Each position is taught from both the offensive and the defensive perspectives. Warm up consists
                        of drills to improve the athlete’s physical ability, directly relevant to Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.
                        After technical instruction, students are paired up to begin isolated positional sparring; this
                        type of live sparring allows for beginners to directly practice the techniques they learned that
                        day by starting from the exact position taught in class. This goes along with free sparring.
                        This ensures that techniques are introduced in a systematic manner that allows for a
                        progressively deeper understanding of the objectives and movements associated with each
                        position. In addition, students are taught principals that make the process of learning
                        Brazilian Jiu Jitsu more efficient and they receive regular individual critique to improve their
                        performance.

                        Along Side our Gi class we also teach No-Gi Brazilian Jiu Jitsu also known as “Submission
                        Wrestling”, applies all the same techniques and principles used in regular Gi Brazilian Jiu
                        Jitsu. Although small variations are often necessary to transition between Gi and No-Gi, it is
                        still important to train Gi Jiu Jitsu, even if you wish to compete entirely in No-Gi. Nearly all
                        of the ADCC Champions (the largest No-Gi Brazilian Jiu Jitsu tournament) train predominately Gi.
                        Marcelo Garcia, believed to be one of the best current No-Gi competitors in the world, trains Gi
                        five days a week and No-Gi once a week. At Fight Club Jiu Jitsu, we have one day dedicated to
                        No-Gi instruction. We compete in both Gi and No-Gi competitions.</p>
